	abstract = {People are increasingly concerned about how tectonic processes affect climate and vice versa. We establish a cross-sphere modeling system for volcanic eruptions and atmosphere circulation on a new Sunway supercomputer with a spatial resolution from 10m locally to 3km globally, using an improved multimedium and multiphase smoothed particle hydrodynamics ({SPH}) combined with a fully coupled meteorology-chemistry global atmospheric modeling scheme. We achieve 400 billion particles and 80\% parallel efficiency using 39,000,000 processor cores. The simulation captures the whole dynamic process of the Tonga eruption from shock waves, earthquakes, tsunamis, mushroom clouds to the following 6--7 days of transport and diffusion of ash and water vapor, and preliminarily obtains the influence effect of full coupling of volcano, earthquake, ocean and atmosphere. This work is of great significance for deeply understanding the interaction between tectonic processes and climate change, and establishing an early warning simulation system for similar global hazard events.},

	abstract = {Forecasting uncertainties among meteorological fields have long been recognized as the main limitation on the accuracy and predictability of air quality forecasts. However, the particular impact of meteorological forecasting uncertainties on air quality forecasts specific to different seasons is still not well known. In this study, a series of forecasts with different forecast lead times for January, April, July, and October of 2018 are conducted over the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei ({BTH}) region and the impacts of meteorological forecasting uncertainties on surface {PM}2.5 concentration forecasts with each lead time are investigated. With increased lead time, the forecasted {PM}2.5 concentrations significantly change and demonstrate obvious seasonal variations. In general, the forecasting uncertainties in monthly mean surface {PM}2.5 concentrations in the {BTH} region due to lead time are the largest (80\%) in spring, followed by autumn ({\textasciitilde}50\%), summer ({\textasciitilde}40\%), and winter (20\%). In winter, the forecasting uncertainties in total surface {PM}2.5 mass due to lead time are mainly due to the uncertainties in {PBL} heights and hence the {PBL} mixing of anthropogenic primary particles. In spring, the forecasting uncertainties are mainly from the impacts of lead time on lower-tropospheric northwesterly winds, thereby further enhancing the condensation production of anthropogenic secondary particles by the long-range transport of natural dust. In summer, the forecasting uncertainties result mainly from the decrease in dry and wet deposition rates, which are associated with the reduction of near-surface wind speed and precipitation rate. In autumn, the forecasting uncertainties arise mainly from the change in the transport of remote natural dust and anthropogenic particles, which is associated with changes in the large-scale circulation.},

	abstract = {An unprecedented heavy rainfall event occurred in Henan Province of central China during 19–20 July 2021 with the maximum hourly rainfall rate of 201.9 mm, which broke the historical record in mainland China. To investigate the impacts of predicted atmospheric circulation on the regional convection-permitting prediction of this event, two sets of nested experiments with different convective parameterizations ({GF} and {MSKF}) in the outer domain and at convection-permitting resolution in the inner domain are performed with the Weather Research and Forecasting ({WRF}) model. The analysis found the prediction of ‘21.7’ rainstorm at convection-permitting resolution in the inner domain is largely affected by convective scheme in the outer domain. The atmospheric circulation forcing from the outer domain with different convective schemes is significantly different, which ultimately affects the regional synoptic pattern and precipitation in the refined region through lateral boundary forcing. The difference in regional prediction at convection-permitting resolution can be mitigated by adjusting convective latent heat parameterization in the outer domain. This work highlights that appropriately parameterizing convective latent heat is the key to provide reasonable large-scale forcing for regionally predicting this catastrophic heavy rainfall event at convection-permitting resolution, which may also be applicable to other events and other regions.},

	abstract = {The Tibetan Plateau ({TP}) is one of the most climate-sensitive regions around the world. Aerosols imported from adjacent regions reach their peak during the pre-monsoon season and play a vital role in the {TP} environment. However, the strong interannual variation in aerosols transported to the {TP} has not been fully understood. Here, we show that the interannual variability of pre-monsoon aerosols transported to the {TP} is influenced more by rainfall over the southern Himalayas than near-surface wind. Rainfall modulates fire events and biomass burning emissions and reduces aerosols over the {TP} by wet scavenging. Contrary to the role of wind in increasing aerosol transport, the positive correlation between wind and aerosols in the {TP} reported in previous studies is contributed by the negative interannual correlations between wind and rainfall and between rainfall and fire events over the southern Himalayas. This study highlights the co-variability of wind and rainfall and their confounding impacts on aerosols in the southern Himalayas and over the {TP}. With pre-monsoon rainfall projected to increase in adjacent regions of southern {TP}, aerosol transport to the {TP} may be mitigated in the future.},

	abstract = {With the computing power of High-Performance Computing ({HPC}) systems having stepped into the exascale era, more complex problems can be solved with scientific applications on a large scale. However, due to the significant performance gap between computing nodes and storage subsystems, suboptimal design for the Input/Output (I/O) module will significantly impede the efficiency of scientific applications, especially for the ubiquitous atmosphere applications. Two-phase I/O implemented in N-to-1 mode creates a serious bottleneck that hinders the scalability for the Model for Prediction Across Scales-Atmosphere ({MPAS}-A) on the new generation Sunway supercomputer. To address the I/O problem, we apply a custom data reorganization method to enable N-to-M I/O mode to exploit the parallel file system's performance and limit the data transfer among {MPI} ranks to a restricted scope to alleviate communication overhead. Moreover, we have conducted several methods to accelerate the computations, including the redesign for tracer transport, a hybrid buffering scheme, and a three-level parallelization scheme, which allows {MPAS}-A to use all heterogeneous computing resources efficiently. Experimental results show admirable scalability and efficiency of our I/O method, which achieves speedups of 41× and 58.9× for input and output compared with the raw I/O method on 30,000 {MPI} ranks. By scaling {MPAS}-A to 39 million heterogeneous cores, we demonstrate the necessity of a well-constructed I/O module for a real-world atmosphere application. Speed tests show that our optimization methods obtain good results for computations, and {MPAS}-A achieves a speed of 0.82 Simulated Day per Hour ({SDPH}) and 0.76 parallel efficiency of strong scaling with 600,000 {MPI} ranks.},

	abstract = {During the era of global warming and highly urbanized development, extreme and high impact weather as well as air pollution incidents influence everyday life and might even cause the incalculable loss of life and property. Although, with the vast development of atmospheric model, there still exists substantial numerical forecast biases objectively. To predict accurately extreme weather, severe air pollution, and abrupt climate change, the numerical atmospheric model requires not only to simulate meteorology and atmospheric compositions simultaneously involving many sophisticated physical and chemical processes but also at high spatiotemporal resolution. Global integrated atmospheric simulation at spatial resolutions of a few kilometers remains challenging due to its intensive computational and input/output (I/O) requirement. Through multi-dimension-parallelism structuring, aggressive and finer-grained optimizing, manual vectorizing, and parallelized I/O fragmenting, an integrated Atmospheric Model Across Scales ({iAMAS}) was established on the new Sunway supercomputer platform to significantly increase the computational efficiency and reduce the I/O cost. The global 3-km atmospheric simulation for meteorology with online integrated aerosol feedbacks with {iAMAS} was scaled to 39,000,000 processor cores and achieved the speed of 0.82 simulation day per hour ({SDPH}) with routine I/O, which enabled us to perform 5-day global weather forecast at 3-km horizontal resolution with online natural aerosol impacts. The results demonstrate the promising future that the increasing of spatial resolution to a few kilometers with online integrated aerosol feedbacks may significantly improve the global weather forecast.},

The analysis focuses on the seasonal average of diurnal variation of precipitation amount ({PA}), intensity ({PI}), and frequency ({PF}). Both simulations reasonably reproduce the spatial distribution of {PA}. V4km is more skillful in simulating the spatial distributions and magnitudes of {PF} and {PI}. The diurnal cycle of Mei-yu rainfall shows a major early morning peak and a minor afternoon peak, contributed by precipitation during two sub-periods with distinct synoptic circulations. With strong Mei-yu in the first sub-period, the diurnal variation of {PA} is controlled by nocturnal southwesterly jet. V4km overestimates the morning peak mainly due to its bias in simulating boundary layer inertial oscillation. Although differences in {PA} between the simulations are small, U60km overestimates {PF} and underestimates {PI}. With weak Mei-yu in the second sub-period, the diurnal variation of {PA} is controlled by both synoptic circulation and local convection. At both resolutions, deviations in the large-scale circulation modulated by a few typhoons lead to positive biases in the morning peak of {PA}. After removing the typhoon impacts, V4km captures the observed diurnal cycle of {PA} well, while U60km significantly underestimates {PA} and {PI} particularly in the afternoon. Future studies focusing on advancing modeling of southwesterly jet and typhoons may further improve convection permitting simulation of Mei-yu rainfall.},

	abstract = {In this study, a global variable-resolution modeling framework of atmospheric dust and its radiative feedback is established and evaluated. In this model, atmospheric dust is simulated simultaneously with meteorological fields, and dust-radiation interactions are included. Five configurations of global mesh with refinement at different resolutions and over different regions are used to explore the impacts of regional refinement on modeling dust lifecycle at regional and global scales. The model reasonably produces the overall magnitudes and spatial variabilities of global dust metrics such as surface mass concentration, deposition, aerosol optical depth, and radiative forcing compared to observations and previous modeling results. Two global variable-resolution simulations with mesh refinement over major deserts of North Africa (V16 km-{NA}) and East Asia (V16 km-{EA}) simulate less dust emissions and smaller dry deposition rates inside the refined regions due to the weakened near-surface wind speed caused by better resolved topographic complexity at higher resolution. The dust mass loadings over North Africa are close to each other between V16 km-{NA} and the quasi-uniform resolution (∼120 km) (U120 km), while over East Asia, V16 km-{EA} simulates higher dust mass loading. Over the non-refined areas with the same resolution, the difference between global variable-resolution and uniform-resolution experiments also exists, which is partly related to their difference in dynamic time-step and the coefficient for horizontal diffusion. Refinement at convection-permitting resolution around the Tibetan Plateau ({TP}) simulates less dust due to its more efficient wet scavenging from resolved convective precipitation around the {TP} against coarse resolution.},
